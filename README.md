# RedditR- Live Trends and Engagement on Reddit
> This is the project I carried out during the seven-week <a href="http://insightdataengineering.com/">Insight Data Engineering Fellows Program </a>
which helps recent grads and experienced software engineers learn the latest open source technologies 
by building a data platform to handle large, real-time datasets. <br/>
RedditR is a real time content engagement platform that helps maximize your content engagement on reddit. The platform gives
you real time trend tracking so you never miss out on anything. 
You can find the app at <a href="http://www.redditr.space> www.redditr.space</a>

## Motivation
The <b>Functional </b>motivation for this project was to create a real-time trending feature
very similar to the one you can find on twitter. With so much interactions happening on reddit, it may be useful for a user
to be able to gauge traction received on a subreddit. 
With so much information out there, it may also be overwhelming for users to navigate across reddit to find the 
contents they like and for this particular reason, i've built in some
features in the app namely "Engagement" and "Snapshot" that lets them track historical stats about that particular subreddit
with dynamic recommendations of subreddits they may like.<br/> 
The <b>Engineering</b> movitation behind building such a product is to demonstrate the ability to create a scalable real-time big data
pipleline using open source technologies.
